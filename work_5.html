              <h2>Why</h2>
              <p>Fingerspelling is a crucial aspect of sign language, particularly in American Sign Language (ASL), where hand shapes represent letters to spell words. It's widely used for various purposes, including spelling names and special words. Teaching fingerspelling to children with hearing impairment early on offers numerous advantages, such as broadening their vocabulary, improving communication and reading skills.</p>

              <h2>What</h2>
              <p>A website to help hearing impaired children learn fingerspelling. In this website, users can learn how to fingerspell each letter of the alphabet, as well as taking quizzes on the fingerspelling they have already learnt and they can even customise the words in their word books. The user can take pictures of the gestures through their computer cameras and the system will recognise if the finger spellings are correct.</p>

              <h2>How</h2>
              <p>This project used convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which is known for their image recognition accuracy. Marcelle's API facilitated the creation of the interface, with the Wizard layout chosen to guide users effectively. TensorFlow's Keras model was employed for training the CNN, and post-training, the model was converted for TensorFlow.js compatibility. Real-time gesture recognition was achieved by processing webcam video streams, allowing for efficient and intuitive learning.</p>
