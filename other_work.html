            In the next 3 seconds, please think of a word to describe older
            people.
            <br />Now please have a look at the poster. Is your word in it or
            close to one of them? <br />The ageing population is often labelled
            as a social problem in not only HCI research but also in everyday
            lives - they suffer from a variety of health issues, have physical
            and cognitive impairments, have difficulty using technology, and
            experience social isolation and loss of independence. Such a
            discourse can be stigmatizing and could hurt older adults’ dignity,
            making them feel less worthy and esteemed. <br />This graphic design
            work, therefore, aims to raise the audience’s awareness of everyday
            ageism. The words in the poster are all commonly used when
            designers, caregivers … and the media talk about older people.
            Through this poster, the audience is encouraged to reflect on their
            own bias, and as a result, avoid using the discourses of decline and
            dependency when talking about ageing from now on to make this
            society more inclusive to older people.
