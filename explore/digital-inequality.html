        The Problem
      </div>
      <div class="article_text">
        <p>Digital inequality refers to individual resource differences, as well as how economic and political forces influence these differences.<sup>1</sup> It is usually the result of numerous demographic factors such as gender, age and race.<sup>2</sup></p>
        <br><p>Today, older adults are often marginalised in society and have low internet engagement. Nearly two million people aged 75 or older in England are still digitally excluded by the year of 2021.<sup>3</sup> To narrow the digital gap, designers and researchers must contextualise the socio-cultural reasons why excluded communities and individuals are unable or reluctant to use the technology.<sup>4</sup></p>
        <div class="article_subtitle">
        The Cause
        </div>
        <div class="article_text">
        <p>The reason many of the older people do not use the internet because they experience age-related physiological impairments such as visual and hearing loss, as well as cognitive problems such as memory loss.<sup>5</sup> They also have many concerns about risks such as internet fraud, data leaks, and radiation. On the other hand, the technology industry is dominated by younger people, so they prefer to design and develop products for younger audiences and thus ignore the needs of older people.<sup>6</sup></p>
        <br><p>The digital inequality could have a set of impacts including seniors’ loneliness and social isolation, and life inconvenience because public services such as banking are increasingly digital to save time and labour cost. To solve the issue of the digital inequality, we need to work to remove the barriers such as by raising the awareness of the tech industry to design products that take care of older adults’ needs. </p>
