        The Problem
      </div>
      <div class="article_text">
        <p>Ageing has always been an important topic being studied in the academic field, and researchers and scholars have designed and developed many products and service systems that are particularly for older adults.</p>
        <br><p>However, they tend to label the ageing population as a social problem<sup>1</sup> and portray them as people with a set of disabilities: They suffer from a variety of health issues, have physical and cognitive impairments, have difficulty using technology, and experience social isolation and loss of independence.<sup>2</sup> As a result of such stereotypes, ageing designs are often used to compensate for seniors’ physical and cognitive decline, thus tend to take over some of their responsibilities.<sup>3</sup></p>
        <br><p>While these designs indeed bring convenience to seniors and their caregivers, they could also have negative effects. First, they limit older adults’ agency. Older adults are given few options for product use so they can hardly choose products based on their needs.<sup>4</sup> Also, when researchers and designers have stereotypes in mind, it will be harder for them to discover any other diverse needs. Furthermore, such a discourse that sees ageing as a social burden could hurt older adults’ dignity. It can be stigmatising<sup>5</sup> and make them feel less worthy and esteemed.<sup>6</sup></p>

        The Solution
      </div>
      <div class="article_text">
        <p>Can we make a change? It is possible if we could try to switch our mindsets, not only when conducting academic research but also in our everyday lives.</p>
        <br><p>For researchers, designers and developers, instead of making designs that served as a form of compensation for older adults’ capability decline, we might focus more on positively empowering them based on their advantageous resources.<sup>7</sup> For instance, in a research that seeks to study older adults’ online behaviours, the researchers applied a positive ageing approach. They let their participants use the internet and asked them about what went well, rather than the difficulties they experienced.<sup>8</sup></p>
        <br><p>For the general public, we might try avoiding using the discourses of decline and dependency when talking about ageing. Besides, if the older adults of our family have limited knowledge of the internet but want to learn about it, we should be patient and encouraging to them. By promoting a positive ageing approach we can make this society more inclusive to older adults.</p>
