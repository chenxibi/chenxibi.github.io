        The Problem
      </div>
      <div class="article_text">
        <p>According to Age UK, 37.6% of people over 65 in England feel lonely from time to time during later life, and more than 1 million (about every 1 in 12) are often socially isolated, which means they go a month without speaking to anyone they know.</p>
        <br><p>Loneliness is associated with a wide range of diseases and disabilities, particularly among seniors.1 It could cause heart attacks, depression, and a variety of other illnesses. The worsening of and reduction in the network of human relationships appears to be a major cause of loneliness.2 Therefore, to reduce loneliness of older adults, their social participation needs to be improved.3</p>
        <div class="article_subtitle">
        The Solution
        </div>
        <div class="article_text">
        <p>Social media self-efficacy could be a solution as it reduces loneliness and increase self-esteem of older adults. It refers to a person's level of social media content creation and consumption, perceived social media proficiency, and confidence in his or her ability to locate information successfully online.4 To put it simply, to achieve a higher level of social media self-efficacy, seniors not only need to have relevant digital skills, but also need to be confident of their skills. Therefore, to do this, we might offer training to them. But more importantly, we need to increase the inclusion of the society to decrease the ageism seniors perceive in their lives so that they will feel better about themselves.</p>
